excerpt: Why should one really learn the German language?
---
Yes! You should learn German. Why it is the best language to learn? 
# Language reflects life
Language is beautifully creative. It really is! 

In German, if you translate 'What time is it?', it'll probably translate to something that looks like 'Wie spät ist es?' Forget how to pronounce it. I'll probably teach you, if we meet in person. 'Wie spät ist es?' literally translates to 'How late is it?' - A true LOL moment! and a true German feeling! 

Well, if you know anything about German stereotypes, you need not go anywhere and simply look at their language. It perfectly mirrors their sense of life, what they are getting at and just generally the German sentiment overall. There are too many such examples to list them here...

In French there are multiple ways of saying 'frying', simply because... French cuisine! In Nepali, it makes me chuckle to say it, but the word 'rice' is different for each of its form. When it's being planted 'dhaanko bid', when it's being harvested 'dhaan', when it's beaten 'chiura', when it's being cooked 'chamal' and after it is cooked 'bhaat'. No wonder we Nepalis eat rice 3 times a day. One need not come to Nepal to find that out, it's perfectly evident simply with our language. 

What I am getting at is, through language you touch the sense of 'what' the country is, and 'who' the people are. One learns to be at home when the language is learnt. 

# Europa! Europa! 
German speaking countries have amassed the gross population of 100 million. Germany, Austria, Switzerland, part of Belgium, Liechtenstein even north Italy all speak German. So, if you want to become a European citizen and subscribe to the European ethos then it's a no-brainer that German takes the cake. 
- German language is the new lingua-franca in European parliament 
- Germany is trying to become a voice of authority in Europe again 

# German Social Welfare
Well that tells it all! Education is free, health care is free and transportation for students is virtually subsidised to be free. Even the new political powers aren't shying away from helping their citizens live the life to the fullest, as feared earlier. 

### Perhaps, the language is hard to crack...
# German genders 
The chair you are sitting on is masculine, the phone is neutral, and the fingers you are using to scroll this article is masculine. Warum? ... Darum! (Why? ....because!)

And it's never ending! There is a little light at the end of the tunnel though, there are some rules you could follow to ascertain which is which. In the defence of German language all other Latin languages other than English do have genders. So that means if genders are concerned, German isn't more difficult than Spanish or Italian. 

# German cases 
And now this gets difficult to defend my favourite language. German has 4 cases. 

What that means is, depending upon the case of the actors (who's doing the action...) it could be in Nominative (when they are subjects), Accusative (when they are direct objects), Dative (when indirect object) and Genetive (when illustrating the relationship between subjects and objects). 

A simple example - Der Vater hat den Sohn. (The father has a son...both masculine nouns). 'Der Vater' is subject and in Nominative. No problem. But 'Der Sohn' becomes object and changes to 'den Sohn'. This confuses so many learners. The article (der Vater/ der Sohn) changes depending upon the case (Nominative, Accusative, Dative or Genetive).

Languages are fun yet tough to cut through. It's not just like learning a new skill (cycling or swimming), it's also to connect with entirely new set of people. You get to add an identity to yourself after learning a language. So, decide if the pros outweigh the cons to learn my favourite language. 

All the best! Ich drucke mir die Daumen. (I'll press my thumbs for you!) 
I'm rooting for you! 

Best,
Sagaritto
